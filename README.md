# Enhancing-Ski-Safety-Utilizing-XAI-to-Explain-LSTM-Based-Velocity-Prediction-from-IMU-Data
Project to explain an LSTM-based velocity prediction for skiers.

The jupyter notebook shows the possibility of explaining calculations of LSTM Models with SHAP DeepExplainer, which is explained in the final report.
